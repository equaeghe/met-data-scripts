# met-data-scripts
Python scripts for transforming specific metocean datasets from text-based to binary formats and checking them for data quality issues

This repository contains scripts used during the analysis of three North Sea metocean datasets used for wind energy research.
Each directory pertains to one dataset.

Within each directory are a number of scripts:

* one or more scripts for transforming text-based dataset files to binary dataset files
* one script for performing automated quality checks on the data
* possibly one helper script

More information is given as comments in the script files and in a `README.md` file in each directory.
_(Once available a reference will be added here to a publication describing the research in the context of which these scripts were created.)_
