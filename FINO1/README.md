File descriptions:

* `dat2nc.py`: script to transform FINO 1 `.dat` files to a netCDF4 file (most recommended)
* `dat2nc-convention-sem.py`: script to transform FINO 1 `.dat` files to a netCDF4 file (not recommended, uses compound data structures, for which software support is still lacking)
* `automated-check-snippets.py`: script for (semi-)automated quality checks, such as outlier detection
* `convention_read.py`: helper code for `automated-check-snippets.py`
* `*.yaml`: metadata files used by the transformation scripts
