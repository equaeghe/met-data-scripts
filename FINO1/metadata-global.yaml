  For each measurement signal, a separate variable is given for each of the
  available statistics, (one or more of minimum ('min'), maximum ('max'),
  average ('avg'), and standard deviation ('std') of the samples within the
  given time) or a value ('val') characterizing the measurement for the
  time interval.
  
  The estimated uncertainty for the statistics is
  	* the instrument's provided error for 'min' and 'max',
  	* the propagated error for 'avg' and 'std'.
      
  The statistics' values are recorded as floating point numbers for which the
  uncertainty is encoded using the following convention: if x is the number
  and e its uncertainty, then we store y = (2 * k ± 1) * d/2, where
  	* d = 2 ** floor(log2(e)) and
  	* k = floor(x / d).
  So y is the odd multiple of d/2 nearest to x. Because y is an odd multiple
  of a power of two, the denominator of y seen as an irreducible fraction
  is 2/d, so that d can effectively be determined from y.
  
  There is also always a 'flag' component in the compound data structure,
  providing information about quality and missingness. The flag values are
  encoded using the following enumeration:
  	* 'missing': -1,
  	* 'raw': 0,
  	* 'doubtful quality': 1,
  	* 'quality controlled': 2.

  Custom dataset attributes:
  	* 'uncertainty_abs' describes the absolute uncertainty of the
        sampled values.
  	* 'uncertainty_rel' describes the relative uncertainty of the 
  	sampled values as a number between 0 and 1.
  	* 'sampling_frequency' describes the frequency in Hz with which the
  	quantity has been sampled, which determines the number n of samples.

  Custom instrument attributes:
  	* 'manufacturer' describes the manufacturer of the instrument,
  	typically by giving its name.
  	* 'part_number' describes the manufacturer's part number for
  	the instrument.
