HDF5-conversion: >-
    The original Excel data files (66, total 938 MB) were converted to this
    single HDF5 file using the Python packages Pandas (Excel data extraction),
    NumPy (data processing), and h5py (HDF5 manipulation) and the h5repack
    utility. The result is a much smaller size (74 MB), convenient data
    access, and the addition of descriptive annotations.
annotations: >-
    The annotations attached to the groups and datasets in this file contain
    not only a general description of those groups or datasets, but also
    information about, for example, device identifiers, units, resolution,
    precision, sampling rate, error propagation, data storage details, etc.

data_processing: >-
    The data as recorded in the source Excel files has been modified.
    Namely, the storage format, standard 8-byte 'float64' format in Excel,
    was reduced for storage and transmission efficiency purposes to 4-byte
    'float32' and individual values were stored in such a way as to encode
    their uncertainty given the information available about resolution and
    precision. This is a 'lossy' but compression-improving transformation.
    (N.B.: Some relevant information has not been found and in that case
    conservative bounds were assumed, so further storage size reduction is
    possible in case those data become available.)
uncertainty_encoding: >-
    The statistics' values are recorded as floating point numbers for which
    the uncertainty is encoded using the following convention: if x is the
    number and e its uncertainty, then we store y = (2 * k Â± 1) * d/2, where
    	* d = 2 ** floor(log2(e)) and
    	* k = floor(x / d).
    So y is the odd multiple of d/2 nearest to x. Because y is an odd
    multiple of a power of two, the denominator of y seen as an irreducible
    fraction is 2/d, so that d can effectively be determined from y.
description: >-
    This file mainly contains the datasets of the met mast at the Egmond
    aan Zee Offshore Wind Farm (OWEZ), which was the first wind farm in the
    Netherlands to be built offshore. Measurements are available from July
    2005, before construction of the wind farm, until December 2011.
    Construction started in April 2006.

    The original data are (at the time of writing) available from the OWEZ
    website <http://www.noordzeewind.nl/>. The data themselves are provided
    as per-month Excel files. Next to the data files themselves, there are
    multiple relevant reports available there as well.
