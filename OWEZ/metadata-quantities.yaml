      From correspondence with the manufacturer, we know that acoustic
      measurements over 512 s (8 minutes 32 s) were the basis for the 'raw'
      values (such as Max and Min), which means that the effective sampling
      frequency may well be lower than 2 Hz. The uncertainty was also an
      assessment expressed in correspondence from the manufacturer.

      From correspondence with the manufacturer, it seems very likely that this

      wave height; they also mentioned a 5 cm uncertainty for this quantity.
      Also, acoustic measurements over 512 s (8 minutes 32 s) were the basis
      for the 'raw' values (such as Max and Min), which means that the
      effective sampling frequency may well be lower than 4 Hz.

    note: >-
      This is described as a 'yes'/'no' sensor. From correspondence with the
      manufacturer, I learned it is meant to be a 'no'/'light'/'medium'/'heavy'
      sensor, but that in practice it is difficult to decide between the latter
      three levels. The log-histogram of the data itself contains a sharp peak
      around 1 that contains a large majority of the data points and a crudely
      uniform distribution of data between 1 and 4. Supposedly, 1 corresponds
      to 'no' and higher values to increasing intensity of precipitation; there
      are a few data points between 0 and 1, but these are likely faulty
      measurements.

      The majority of missing (Max, Min)-value pairs with non-missing Mean
      value occur when Mean is close to 0 degree or 360 degree, so this data is
      'MNAR', missing not at random, and is non-ignorable.
      (Possibly, such value pairs were removed to mistakenly avoid Min-values
      smaller than Max-values, although that makes perfect sense for
      directional data.)

      recorded values did not significantly decrease the uncertainty.
