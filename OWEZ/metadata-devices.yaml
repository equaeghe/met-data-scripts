  note: >-
    The version is unknown. However, from the generic October 2014 information
    brochure from Nortek about this line of devices and the given depth of
    17Â m, we assume this device uses a 1 MHz acoustic frequency. Based on that,
    we assume to know from the brochure the sampling frequencies for the
    different quantities; these are conservative in the sense that they are the
    highest described as possible and consequently the most precise Mean and
    StdDev estimates.
